# latent-career-skills

Modeling of latent NBA player career skills.

For now we're modeling the latent career skill trajectories as quadratic with the parameterization

$$
f(t) = c (t - a) (t - b)
$$

We would like $f(t) = 0$ to represent the latent skill of an average replacement player. Thus at $t = a, b$ represents when a player is equivalent to a replacement player at the beginning and end of their player.
